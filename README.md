Artemis Financial is a consulting firm specializing in crafting personalized financial plans for its clients. We were engaged to create their public web application while also enhancing its security measures to handle the delicate personal and financial information at stake.
My role involved effectively identifying existing weaknesses within the codebase through thorough static testing. Prioritizing secure coding practices is crucial in mitigating the risk of data breaches and safeguarding the company's reputation for trustworthiness and dependability.

The utilization of a dependency check tool proved to be highly advantageous, speeding up identifying vulnerabilities by automating the detection process for potential weaknesses within dependencies, ultimately eliminating the need for manual scrutiny.

In projects to come, incorporating penetration testing will be essential to comprehensively evaluate potential vulnerabilities.

A recurring task involved re-executing the dependency check tool whenever new dependencies were introduced. Otherwise, relying on unit testing and meticulous manual code review guarantees the preservation of functionality.

During the project, I leveraged online resources to research contemporary best practices and algorithms, which played a pivotal role in enhancing the project's overall quality.

From this assignment I would show future employers how I integrated the dependency-check plug-in into Maven and ran a dependency check on Artemis Financialsâ€™ software application to identify all security vulnerabilities in the code.
